Run_Analysis.R R-script on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
### Version 1.0
The run_analysis.R script reads data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" and produces a new - tidy - dataset which may be used for further analysis.
The data in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" have been taken from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz data were captured. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
### The original dataset included the following data files
*	'features.txt': List of all features.
*	'activity_labels.txt': List of class labels and their activity name.
*	'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
*	'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
*	'train/subject_train.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data
*	'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
*	'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
*	'test/subject_test.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data
